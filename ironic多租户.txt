nova bp分析：

1：To keep the provisioning process away from the tenant network, we need to wait for the deployment to complete before binding the port, which only Ironic can control.
为了使得部署过程远离租户网络，在绑定port之前需要等待部署过程完成，这个过程只有ironic可以控制。

 As part of the deployment process, Ironic will make a port-update call with: 1) a binding:host_id value of “baremetal:$node_uuid”, and 2) physical switchport information necessary to connect the port. This will happen while the virt driver is waiting for the Ironic node to get a state of “active”.
